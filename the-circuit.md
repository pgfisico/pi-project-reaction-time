# The Circuit

Using your knowledge of electrical circuit components, construct a circuit on your breadboard which connects the LED and both buttons to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. Place the LED centrally so both players can see the LED, and place each button on opposite sides of the LED. Keep track of which GPIO pins you used, so you can use the right numbers in your code.
